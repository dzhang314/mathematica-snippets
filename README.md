# David's Mathematica Snippets

This repository contains useful pieces of Mathematica (aka Wolfram Language) code which I consider too small to be worth organizing into proper packages. I make them freely available online in hopes that they will be useful to others. All of this code was written for personal purposes, and I make no guarantees regarding correctness, performance, or quality of documentation.
